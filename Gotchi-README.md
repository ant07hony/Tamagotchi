'Gotchi - Sitter
 
 Description: 
 Become a Tama'Gotchi-Sitter. When you arrive, give a nickname to your bundle of energy (or not...) and keep them happy by playing, feeding and cleaning them. Failing to do so will cause them to RUN AWAY! They can be demanding but once they reach the age of 5 it's time for pickup and your job will be complete.
